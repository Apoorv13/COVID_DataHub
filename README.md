# COVID-19 SES Data Hub from Hopkins Population Center

## HPC Data Hub Phase 1 Release （4/20/2020）

The HPC Data Hub is a newly established data service infrastructure of the [Hopkins Population Center (HPC)](https://popcenter.jhu.edu/). The HPC Data Hub offers critical U.S. county-level data necessary for population-based social science, epidemiological, medical and public health research on COVID-19 to provide evidence-based, timely policy recommendations for curbing the pandemic. 

The last few weeks have demonstrated that timely and effective data on social, economic and health disparities are needed to respond appropriately to the pandemic as local situations change. Drawing from trusted sources, this data hub curates data on the demographic, social and health factors that influence the spread of COVID-19. The data hub also includes COVID-19 related policies being rolled out across the country. 

The major data sources of socioeconomic (SES) data include Census Bureau, IRS, CDC, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis. The COVID-19 data are drawn from JHU CSSE.

The data are publicly accessible at our GitHub repository and will be released in phases.

Phase 1 of the HPC Data Hub data includes 522 variables in 3,142 counties in 50 states and D.C. Phase 1 includes three datasets: 

-	**Pandemic dataset** (195 variables) during the pandemic period: daily pandemic data (confirmed cases and deaths); county-level policy actions (timing or indicator of the enactment of 17 policy actions, e.g., the date of emergency declaration). 
-	**Prepandemic dataset** (281 variables) before the pandemic period: health and healthcare disparities, income and tax filing, number of people per housing unit, population density, and demographic structure by age, gender and race-ethnicity.
-	**Unemployment dataset** (46 variables) before and during the pandemic period: monthly data on labor force and unemployment and the county identity of spatial neighbors (for spatial analysis)

County names and FIPS codes are provided to facilitate data combination. Each dataset is accompanied by a dictionary with variable labels and data sources.

We are currently working on Phase 2, which includes the following: 
-	Measures of social distancing behavior using human mobility data
-	Daily reporting on COVID-19 testing
-	Ongoing reporting on hospital and healthcare capacity
We expect to release Phase 2 on 4/30/2020.
